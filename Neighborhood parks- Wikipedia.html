    <h1>Neighborhood parks</h1>

    <h6>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h6>

    <p class="abc"><strong>Neighborhood parks</strong>, which generally range in size up to 30 acres (120,000 m2), serve as a social and recreational focal points for neighborhoods and are the basic units of a<br>
                  park system. Many include a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Playground"><strong>playground</strong></a>.<br>
                  <br>
                  Neighborhood parks provide relief from the built environment for residents. They may offer a range of facilities and passive or active (programmed or unprogrammed) recreation<br>
                  in response to demographic and cultural characteristics of surrounding neighborhoods, with opportunities for interaction with nature. Neighborhood parks are largely accessible<br>
                  by foot, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicycle">bicycle</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_transport">public transit</a> within at least a quarter-mile radius from residences, providing easy access especially for children and senior adults.<br>
                  <br>
                  Types of neighborhood parks include "mini-parks" or "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocket_park">pocket parks</a>," and may be further described by their predominant recreational offering. They may provide greenscape,<br>
                  recreation centers, sports fields, or playgrounds. A greenscape is a landscaped park, often with a large un-programmed lawn, primarily for passive recreation. A recreation<br>
                  center is a facility that supports myriad park activities, including sports and other recreational activities appropriate to the population or community that uses the park. Mini parks<br>
                  or pocket parks are the smallest in size, designed to serve the immediate surrounding neighborhood. Generally, size limits the ability to serve multiple recreational functions.<br>
                  <br>
                  Many park systems are underfunded and rely upon grassroots neighborhood-park groups and associations. Many of these groups join together in broad coalitions <a href="http://www.sfnpc.org/index.html">[1]</a> to<br>
                  advocate for better park maintenance and government accountability.</p>

    <h3>Location and Access</h3><p>[ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Neighborhood_parks&action=edit&section=1">edit</a> ]</p>

    <p class="abc">A neighborhood park should be centrally located, if possible, within its service area and should be uninterrupted by non-residential roads or other physical barriers. The site<br>
                  should be generally flat and usable. It should be accessible by way of interconnecting trails, public transportation, sidewalks, or low-volume residential streets.<br>
                  <br>
                  A neighborhood park primarily serves residents within about 1/4 mile of the park, without physical or social barriers to the boundaries.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ease of access from the surrounding neighborhood, central location, and linkage to greenways are key concerns when selecting a new park site. The site itself should<br>
                  allow active and passive recreation uses. Since one of the primary reasons people go to a park is to experience a pleasant outdoor environment, the site should exhibit some innate<br>
                  aesthetic qualities. “Left-over” parcels of land that are undesirable for development are not generally desirable for neighborhood parks.<br>
                  <br>
                  The expressed wishes of nearby residents should guide the development or redevelopment plans for each park. Creating a sense of place by bringing together the unique<br>
                  characteristics of the site with the vision of the neighborhood is vital.</p>
