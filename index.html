  <br>

  <p class="2" id="b">Origin Farms is a rice plantation on Plum Hill Plantation in South Carolina. Lucie Kulze founded the farm in 2015 and seeks to renew the rice plantation
    that was once there.The farm's vision is to connect the community to locally grown,seasonal produce beyond the rice crop. Today, you can find Origin Farm's rice in the
    downtown Charleston's local farmers market. Look out for it!</p>
